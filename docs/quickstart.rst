Getting Started
===============

The ``theanets`` package provides tools for defining and optimizing several
common types of neural network models. It uses Python for rapid development, and
under the hood Theano_ provides graph optimization and fast computations on the
GPU.

This page provides a quick overview of the ``theanets`` package. It is aimed at
getting you up and running with a few examples. Once you understand the basic
workflow, you will be able to extend the examples to your own datasets and
modeling problems. After you've finished reading through this document, have a
look at the :doc:`guide` for more detailed usage information, and see the
:doc:`reference` for detailed API documentation.

Installation
============

If you haven't already, the first thing you should do is download and install
``theanets``. The easiest way to do this is by using ``pip``::

  pip install theanets

This command will automatically install all of the dependencies for
``theanets``, including ``numpy`` and ``theano``.

To work through the documentation you should also install a couple of supporting
packages::

  pip install skdata
  pip install matplotlib

These will help you obtain the example dataset described below, and also help in
making plots of various things.

Package Overview
================

At a high level, the ``theanets`` package is a tool for (a) defining and (b)
optimizing cost functions over a set of data. The workflow in ``theanets``
typically involves three basic steps:

#. First, you *define* the structure of the model that you'll use for your task.
   For instance, if you're trying to classify MNIST digits, you'll want
   something that takes in pixels and outputs digit classes (a "classifier"). If
   you're trying to model the unlabeled digit images, you might want to use a
   model that uses the same data for input and output (an "autoencoder").
#. Second, you *train* or adjust the parameters in your model so that it has a
   low cost or performs well with respect to some task. For classification, you
   might want to adjust your model parameters to minimize the negative
   log-likelihood of the correct image class given the pixels, and for
   autoencoders you might want to minimize the reconstruction error.

   A significant component of this step usually involves preparing the data that
   you'll use to train your model.
#. Finally, you *use* the trained model in some way, probably by predicting
   results on a test dataset, visualizing the learned features, and so on.

The ``theanets`` package provides a helper class, :class:`Experiment
<theanets.main.Experiment>`, that performs these tasks with relatively low
effort on your part. You typically define a model in ``theanets`` by creating an
experiment with a number of *model hyperparameters* that define the specific
behavior of your model, and then train your model using another set of
*optimization hyperparameters* that define the behavior of the optimization
algorithm.

The skeleton of your code will usually look something like this::

  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  import skdata.mnist
  import theanets

  # create an experiment to define a model.
  exp = theanets.Experiment(
      Model,
      hyperparam1=value1,
      hyperparam2=value2,
      # ...
  )

  # train the model.
  exp.train(
      training_data,
      validation_data,
      optimize='foo',
      # ...
  )

  # use the trained model.
  model = exp.network
  model.predict(test_data)

This quickstart document shows how to implement these stages by following a
couple of examples.

Classifying MNIST Digits
========================

A standard benchmark for neural network
:class:`classification <theanets.feedforward.Classifier>` is the `MNIST digits
dataset <http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/>`_, a set of 70,000 28Ã—28 images of
hand-written digits. Each MNIST digit is labeled with the correct digit class
(0, 1, ... 9). This example shows how to use ``theanets`` to create and train a
model that can perform this task.

Networks for classification map a layer of continuous-valued inputs, through one
or more hidden layers, to an output layer that is activated through the `softmax
function`_. The softmax generates output that can be treated as a categorical
distribution over the digit labels given the input image.

.. _softmax function: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_function

Defining the model
------------------

Now that you know which model to use for this task, you'll need to define some
hyperparameters that determine the structure of your network. The most important
of these is choosing a set of layer sizes that you want in your model.

The first ("input") and last ("output") layers in your network must match the
size of the data you'll be providing. For an MNIST classification task, this
means your network must have 784 inputs (one for each image pixel) and 10
outputs (one for each class).

Between the input and output layers, on the other hand, can be any number of
so-called "hidden" layers, in almost any configuration. Models with more than
about two hidden layers are commonly called "deep" models and have been quite
popular recently due to their success on a variety of difficult machine learning
problems. For now, though, to keep things simple, let's start out with a model
that just has one hidden layer with 100 units.

Once you've chosen the layers you want in your model, the easiest way to use
``theanets`` is to create an :class:`Experiment <theanets.main.Experiment>` to
construct your model::

  exp = theanets.Experiment(
      theanets.Classifier,
      layers=(784, 100, 10))

This is all that's required to get started. There are many different types of
available hyperparameters that can be useful when constructing a model; see
:ref:`guide-model-hyperparameters` for more information.

Preparing the data
------------------

In ``theanets``, the parameters of a model are initialized randomly. To improve
the model's performance on the task, you'll need to train the model parameters.
This training process requires a dataset to compute gradient and loss function
values.

In the case of the MNIST digits, our classifier model will consume a dataset
consisting of two parts---"samples" (image pixels) and corresponding "labels"
(integer class values). Each of these parts is provided as a ``numpy`` array:
the samples are a two-dimensional array, with vectorized MNIST pixels arranged
along the first axis and pixel data arranged along the second axis; the labels
are a one-dimensional array, with one integer value per MNIST image.

For easy access to the MNIST digits dataset, we'll use the ``skdata`` package
and write a little bit of glue code to get the data into the desired format::

  def load_mnist():
      mnist = skdata.mnist.dataset.MNIST()
      mnist.meta  # trigger download if needed.
      def arr(n, dtype):
          # convert an array to the proper shape and dtype
          arr = mnist.arrays[n]
          return arr.reshape((len(arr), -1)).astype(dtype)
      train_images = arr('train_images', 'f') / 255.
      train_labels = arr('train_labels', np.uint8)
      test_images = arr('test_images', 'f') / 255.
      test_labels = arr('test_labels', np.uint8)
      return ((train_images[:50000], train_labels[:50000, 0]),
              (train_images[50000:], train_labels[50000:, 0]),
              (test_images, test_labels[:, 0]))

Here we've rescaled the image data so that each pixel lies in the interval [0,
1] instead of the default [0, 255]. (In general, it's a good idea to standardize
the data for your problem so that each dimension has approximately the same
scale.) We've also reshaped the data as described above.

.. note::

   Because ``theanets`` uses Theano for its computations, most datasets need to
   be cast to a value that is compatible with your setting for
   `Theano's "floatX" configuration parameter`_. Unless you have a really
   expensive GPU, this is likely to mean that you need to use 32-bit floats.

.. _Theano's "floatX" configuration parameter: http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/library/config.html#config.floatX

The load function returns a training split (the first 50000 examples), a
validation split (the remainder of the training data from ``skdata``, containing
10000 examples), and a test split (the test split from ``skdata``, containing
10000 examples). The training dataset is used to compute parameter updates, and
the validation dataset is used to determine when the model has stopped
improving during training.

Training the model
------------------

Now that you have a model and some data, you're ready to train the model so that
it performs the classification task as well as possible. The :class:`Experiment
<theanets.main.Experiment>` class handles the general case of training with
fairly little work.

The main decision to make during training is to choose the training algorithm to
use, along with values for any associated hyperparameters. This is most
naturally accomplished using the :func:`train()
<theanets.main.Experiment.train>` method of the experiment object::

  train, valid, test = load_mnist()

  exp.train(train,
            valid,
            optimize='nag',
            learning_rate=1e-3,
            momentum=0.9)

The first positional argument to this method is the training dataset, and the
second (if provided) is a validation dataset. (These positional arguments can
also be passed to :func:`Experiment.train() <theanets.main.Experiment.train>`
using the ``train_set`` and ``valid_set`` keywords, respectively.) If a
validation dataset is not provided, the training dataset will be used for
validation.

The ``optimize`` keyword argument specifies an algorithm to use for training.
(If you do not provide a value for this argument, ``'rmsprop'`` is used by
default, using the :class:`RmsProp <theanets.trainer.RmsProp>` algorithm.) Any
subsequent keyword arguments will be passed to the training algorithm; these
arguments typically specify hyperparameters of the algorithm like the learning
rate and so forth.

The available training methods are described in the :doc:`guide`; here we've
specified :class:`Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient <theanets.trainer.NAG>`, a
type of stochastic gradient descent with momentum.

Saving and loading
------------------

The :class:`Experiment <theanets.main.Experiment>` class can snapshot your model
automatically during training. When you call :func:`Experiment.train()
<theanets.main.Experiment.train>`, you can provide the following keyword
arguments:

- ``save_progress``: This should be a string containing a filename where the
  model should be saved.

- ``save_every``: This should be a numeric value specifying how often the model
  should be saved during training. If this value is positive, it specifies the
  number of training iterations between checkpoints; if it is negative, it
  specifies the number of minutes that are allowed to elapse between
  checkpoints.

If you provide a ``save_progress`` argument when you construct your experiment,
and a model exists in the given snapshot file, then that model will be loaded
from disk.

You can also save and load models manually by calling :func:`Experiment.save()
<theanets.main.Experiment.save>` and :func:`Experiment.load()
<theanets.main.Experiment.load>`, respectively.

Computing feedforward activations
---------------------------------

Once you've trained a model, you will probably want to do something useful with
it. If you are working in a production environment, you might want to use the
model to make predictions about incoming data; if you are doing research, you
might want to examine the parameters that the model has learned.

For all neural network models, you can compute the activation of the output
layer by calling :func:`Network.predict()
<theanets.feedforward.Network.predict>`::

  results = exp.network.predict(new_dataset)

You pass a ``numpy`` array containing data to the method, which returns an array
containing one row of output activations for each row of input data.

You can also compute the activations of all layers in the network using the
:func:`Network.feed_forward() <theanets.feedforward.Network.feed_forward>`
method::

  for layer in exp.network.feed_forward(new_dataset):
      print(abs(layer).sum(axis=1))

This method returns a sequence of arrays, one for each layer in the network.
Like ``predict()``, each output array contains one row for every row of input
data.

Additionally, for classifiers, you can obtain predictions for new data using the
:func:`Classifier.classify() <theanets.feedforward.Classifier.classify>`
method::

  classes = exp.network.classify(new_dataset)

This returns a vector of integers; each element in the vector gives the greedy
(argmax) result across the categories for the corresponding row of input data.

Visualizing learned features
----------------------------

Many times it is useful to create a plot of the features that the model learns;
this can be useful for debugging model performance, but also for interpreting
the dataset through the "lens" of the learned features.

The weights connecting successive layers of neurons in the model are available
using :func:`Network.get_weights() <theanets.feedforward.Network.get_weights>`.
This method takes an integer, the index of the layer to retrieve weights for,
and returns an array containing the weights. For "encoding" layers in the
network, this array contains a feature vector in each column (for "decoding"
layers, the features are in each row).

For a dataset like the MNIST digits, you can reshape the learned features and
visualize them as though they were 28Ã—28 images::

  img = np.zeros((28 * 10, 28 * 10), dtype='f')
  for i, pix in enumerate(exp.network.get_weights(0).T):
      r, c = divmod(i, 10)
      img[r * 28:(r+1) * 28, c * 28:(c+1) * 28] = pix.reshape((28, 28))
  plt.imshow(img, cmap=plt.cm.gray)
  plt.show()

In this example, the weights in layer 0 connect the inputs to the first hidden
layer; these weights have one column of 784 values for each hidden node in the
network, so we can iterate over the transpose and put each column -- properly
reshaped -- into a giant image.

Using the Command Line
======================

The ``theanets`` package was designed from the start to use the command line for
configuring most aspects of defining and training a model.

If you work in a command-line environment, you can leave many of the
hyperparameters for your model unspecified when constructing your
:class:`Experiment <theanets.main.Experiment>`, and instead specify the
configuration of your network using flags defined on the command line::

    exp = theanets.Experiment(theanets.Classifier)

This will create the same network as the classification model described above if
you run your file as::

    (venv)~$ mnist-classifier.py --layers 784 100 10

In both cases, the model has one input layer with 784 units, one hidden layer
containing 100 model neurons, and one softmax output layer with 10 units.

.. note::
   Command-line arguments do not work when running ``theanets`` code in IPython;
   within IPython, all parameters must be specified as keyword arguments.

You can set many more hyperparameters on the command line. Use the ``--help``
flag from the command line to show the options that are currently available.
